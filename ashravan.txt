The Emperor Ashravan opened his eyes to a world he had never truly seen. For ninety-three days, Shai had meticulated crafted his soul, restoring the man he once was—a scholar, a dreamer, a leader who valued art over conquest.

He remembered everything now. The libraries he'd commissioned. The debates with philosophers that lasted until dawn. The way he'd wept at his first opera. These memories felt more real than the decades of mechanical rule that followed his original soul's corruption.

But as he walked the palace halls, documents in hand, a terrible realization crept over him like frost. His advisors watched him with calculating eyes. The military commanders exchanged glances when he suggested peace talks with neighboring kingdoms. Even his own nephew, Gaotona's grandson, seemed uncomfortable with his newfound passion for education reform.

They had not loved the real Ashravan. They had loved the puppet.

Three months after his restoration, an assassin's blade found his chambers. Ashravan didn't fight. Instead, he sat calmly at his desk, finishing a letter to Shai—wherever she had fled. In it, he thanked her for the greatest gift: not the extra years of life, but the knowledge of who he truly was.

"You gave me back my soul," he wrote, "and now I understand why it was taken in the first place. A poet cannot rule an empire built on blood. But I would rather die as myself than live forever as their tool."

The assassin hesitated at the doorway, watching the Emperor seal the letter with wax.

"Tell them," Ashravan said softly, not turning around, "that the restoration held. That Shai's work was flawless. Tell them that when they replace me, it will be murder, not mercy."

The blade fell. The letter remained.

And in a distant province, Shai—reading the news weeks later—allowed herself one tear for the man she'd saved, then destroyed by saving.
