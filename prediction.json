  "rate": 0.0375,
  "reason": "By December 2025, the Federal Reserve is likely to have reduced the Fed Funds rate to approximately 3.75% (0.0375) from the elevated levels of 2023-2024. Several factors support this prediction: inflation is expected to continue moderating toward the Fed's 2% target throughout 2025, the labor market should stabilize to more sustainable levels, and the cumulative effect of previous rate hikes will have worked through the economy. The Fed typically cuts rates gradually, and starting from a range of 4.25-4.50% in early 2025, several 25 basis point cuts throughout the year would bring the rate to this level. This assumes no major economic shocks, continued progress on inflation, and a soft landing scenario rather than a recession."
